# Volume-Calculator
This calculator isn't any calculator, it can actually calculate the volume of 3D objects! This includes a sphere, a cone, a cube, a cylinder, a triangular prism, and a rectuangular prism. Unfortunately, you must press the clear button before the next calculation. You may also want to round some of the answers to the nearest hundreth to make numbers more clean and easier to use.
